# Home-LAN-Fun
Repository for tutorials showing how to create home servers for fun using docker and portainer. I originally set up mine using the Pi-Hosted repo by Novaspirit who both has a great repo and an amaziing youtube series following allong. The area where this mainly differs is that i have created stacks complete with config with multiple containers to quickly spin up applications preset with variables. This repository is best when used in conjuntion with my youtube series explaining the full archeteture of my home lab.


## App Template
I've included for you a template of a few stacks, each stack contains multiple containers that I use for various uses, the vision is to have a one-click creation of a media server, core network tools, and general apps that I use in my home lab. Additionally, I wanted to include the option to edit the docker-compose.yml to choose what apps are included in the stack and easily change the environmental variables to match your home network settings.

## Apps List

## Instalation Steps
 ### Setup OS
 ### Install  Portainer
 ### Add Template
 
## ARM32 support
ARM32 support is being dropped, for that reason, i do not have any environment in my home lab using it and this repo is only tested to support AMD64.
