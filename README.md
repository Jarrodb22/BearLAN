Repository for tutorials showing how to create home servers for fun using docker


# App Template
I've included for you a template of a few stacks, each stack contains multiple containers that I use for various uses, the vision is to have a one-click creation of a media server, core network tools, and general apps that I use in my home lab. Additionally, I wanted to include the option to edit the docker-compose.yml to choose what apps are included in the stack and easily change the environmental variables to match your home network settings.
